#### [Start using ClearML](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/getting_started/ds/ds_first_steps) 


1. Sign up for free to the [ClearML Hosted Service](https://app.clear.ml) (alternatively, you can set up your own server, see [here](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/clearml_server)).

    > **_ClearML Demo Server:_** ClearML no longer uses the demo server by default. To enable the demo server, set the `CLEARML_NO_DEFAULT_SERVER=0`
    > environment variable. Credentials aren't needed, but experiments launched to the demo server are public, so make sure not 
    > to launch sensitive experiments if using the demo server.

1. Install the `clearml` python package:

    ```bash
    pip install clearml
    ```

1. Connect the ClearML SDK to the server by [creating credentials](https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration), then execute the command
below and follow the instructions: 

    ```bash
    clearml-init
    ```

1. Add two lines to your code:
    ```python
    from clearml import Task
    task = Task.init(project_name='examples', task_name='hello world')
    ```

And you are done! Everything your process outputs is now automagically logged into ClearML.

Next step, automation! **Learn more about ClearML's two-click automation [here](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/getting_started/mlops/mlops_first_steps)**. 

## ClearML Architecture

The ClearML run-time components:

* The ClearML Python Package - for integrating ClearML into your existing scripts by adding just two lines of code, and optionally extending your experiments and other workflows with ClearML's powerful and versatile set of classes and methods.
* The ClearML Server - for storing experiment, model, and workflow data; supporting the Web UI experiment manager and MLOps automation for reproducibility and tuning. It is available as a hosted service and open source for you to deploy your own ClearML Server.
* The ClearML Agent - for MLOps orchestration, experiment and workflow reproducibility, and scalability.

## Why ClearML?

ClearML is our solution to a problem we share with countless other researchers and developers in the machine
learning/deep learning universe: Training production-grade deep learning models is a glorious but messy process.
ClearML tracks and controls the process by associating code version control, research projects,
performance metrics, and model provenance.

We designed ClearML specifically to require effortless integration so that teams can preserve their existing methods
and practices. 

  - Use it on a daily basis to boost collaboration and visibility in your team 
  - Create a remote job from any experiment with a click of a button
  - Automate processes and create pipelines to collect your experimentation logs, outputs, and data
  - Store all your data on any object-storage solution, with the most straightforward interface possible
  - Make your data transparent by cataloging it all on the ClearML platform

We believe ClearML is ground-breaking. We wish to establish new standards of true seamless integration between
experiment management, MLOps, and data management.

## Who We Are

ClearML is supported by you and the [clear.ml](https://clear.ml) team, which helps enterprise companies build scalable MLOps. 

We built ClearML to track and control the glorious but messy process of training production-grade deep learning models.
We are committed to vigorously supporting and expanding the capabilities of ClearML.

We promise to always be backwardly compatible, making sure all your logs, data, and pipelines will always upgrade with you.
